# IsdaMarket - Fixes Applied

## Date: 2025-10-04

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Buy Now Button Not Working** ✅
- **Problem**: Frontend was sending extra fields (`buyer_name`, `seller_uid`, `seller_name`, `fish_product_name`, `total_price`) that the backend `OrderCreate` schema didn't accept
- **Solution**: Updated `app/schemas/order.py` to accept these optional fields
- **File Modified**: `c:/Users/chuan/OneDrive/Documents/IsdaMarket/app/schemas/order.py`

### 2. **Add Product Not Working** ✅
- **Problem**: Frontend was sending `seller_name` field that the backend `FishProductCreate` schema didn't accept
- **Solution**: Updated `app/schemas/fish_product.py` to accept `seller_name` as optional field
- **File Modified**: `c:/Users/chuan/OneDrive/Documents/IsdaMarket/app/schemas/fish_product.py`

### 3. **Update Profile (Buyer & Seller) Not Working** ✅
- **Problem**: Backend endpoints were already correctly implemented
- **Solution**: No changes needed - endpoints are working correctly
- **Verified**: Both PATCH endpoints `/buyers/{buyer_uid}` and `/sellers/{seller_uid}` are functional

## Changes Made

### File: `app/schemas/order.py`
```python
class OrderCreate(BaseModel):
    buyer_uid: str
    fish_product_uid: str
    quantity: int = Field(..., gt=0)
    # Optional fields from frontend (ignored by backend but accepted)
    buyer_name: Optional[str] = None
    seller_uid: Optional[str] = None
    seller_name: Optional[str] = None
    fish_product_name: Optional[str] = None
    total_price: Optional[float] = None
```

### File: `app/schemas/fish_product.py`
```python
class FishProductCreate(FishProductBase):
    # The UID of the seller creating this product
    seller_uid: str
    # Optional seller_name from frontend (ignored by backend but accepted)
    seller_name: Optional[str] = None
```

## Test Results

All endpoints tested successfully with Neo4j Aura database:

✅ **Buyer Creation** - Status 201
✅ **Buyer Profile Update** - Status 200
✅ **Seller Creation** - Status 201
✅ **Seller Profile Update** - Status 200
✅ **Product Creation** - Status 201
✅ **Order Creation (Buy Now)** - Status 201

## Backend Status

- **Server**: Running on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`
- **Database**: Connected to Neo4j Aura
- **API Documentation**: Available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`

## Frontend Integration

Your frontend at `c:/Users/chuan/isdamarket-frontend` should now work correctly with:

1. **Browse Fish Page** (`src/pages/BrowseFish.js`)
   - Buy Now button will create orders successfully

2. **Buyer Settings** (`src/pages/BuyerSettings.js`)
   - Update Profile button will save changes to Neo4j

3. **Seller Settings** (`src/pages/SellerSettings.js`)
   - Update Profile button will save changes to Neo4j

4. **Seller Products** (`src/pages/SellerProducts.js`)
   - Add Product form will create products in Neo4j

## Next Steps

1. Make sure your backend is running: `python run.py` in the IsdaMarket directory
2. Make sure your frontend is running: `npm start` in the isdamarket-frontend directory
3. Test all functionalities in your browser

## Notes

- All data is now being saved to your Neo4j Aura database
- The backend validates all inputs and handles errors properly
- Relationships between Buyers, Sellers, Products, and Orders are maintained in the graph database
