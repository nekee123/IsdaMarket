## 🔧 Fix Applied

### Issue Found:
The `reviewed` field was missing from the order response, which the frontend needs to show/hide the "Write Review" button.

### Fix Applied:
Added `reviewed` field to `OrderController._to_response()` method that:
- Checks if a review exists for the order
- Returns `true` if reviewed, `false` if not
- Handles errors gracefully

**Location:** `app/controllers/order_controller.py` lines 187-200

**Code Added:**
```python
# Check if order has been reviewed
reviewed = False
if order.uid:
    try:
        driver = get_db()
        with driver.session() as session:
            review_check = session.run(
                "MATCH (r:Review {order_uid: $order_uid}) RETURN count(r) as count",
                {"order_uid": order.uid}
            )
            result = review_check.single()
            reviewed = result["count"] > 0 if result else False
    except Exception:
        reviewed = False
```

## 🎯 Why Data Might Not Appear in Neo4j

If you're not seeing data in Neo4j Aura, it could be:

### 1. **Connection Issue**
Check your `.env` file has correct credentials:
```env
NEO4J_URI=neo4j+s://xxxxx.databases.neo4j.io
NEO4J_USER=neo4j
NEO4J_PASSWORD=your-password
```

### 2. **Server Not Running**
Make sure your FastAPI server is running:
```bash
cd c:\Users\chuan\OneDrive\Documents\IsdaMarket
python run.py
```

### 3. **No Test Data Yet**
The database might be empty because no one has:
- Submitted a review
- Sent a message
- Placed an order

### 4. **Looking at Wrong Database**
Make sure you're checking the correct Neo4j Aura instance that matches your `.env` file.

## 🧪 Test Your Backend

### Test 1: Create a Review
```bash
curl -X POST "https://isdamarket-3.onrender.com/reviews/" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "buyer_uid": "test_buyer_123",
    "buyer_name": "Test Buyer",
    "seller_uid": "test_seller_456",
    "order_uid": "test_order_789",
    "rating": 5,
    "comment": "Great fish!"
  }'
```

**Then check Neo4j:**
```cypher
MATCH (r:Review {buyer_uid: "test_buyer_123"}) RETURN r
```

### Test 2: Send a Message
```bash
curl -X POST "https://isdamarket-3.onrender.com/messages/" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "sender_uid": "test_buyer_123",
    "sender_type": "buyer",
    "recipient_uid": "test_seller_456",
    "recipient_type": "seller",
    "message": "Is the fish fresh?"
  }'
```

**Then check Neo4j:**
```cypher
MATCH (m:Message {sender_uid: "test_buyer_123"}) RETURN m
```

### Test 3: Check Notifications
```bash
curl "https://isdamarket-3.onrender.com/notifications/seller/test_seller_456"
```

**Should return the notification created by the review!**

---

## 📋 Verification Checklist

Run these queries in Neo4j Aura Browser to verify:

```cypher
// 1. Check all node types
MATCH (n) RETURN DISTINCT labels(n) as NodeType, count(n) as Count

// 2. Check reviews
MATCH (r:Review) RETURN r LIMIT 10

// 3. Check messages
MATCH (m:Message) RETURN m LIMIT 10

// 4. Check notifications
MATCH (n:Notification) RETURN n LIMIT 10

// 5. Check if any data exists
MATCH (n) RETURN count(n) as TotalNodes
```

**If TotalNodes = 0:** Database is empty (no test data created yet)
**If TotalNodes > 0:** Database has data!

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. Verify Neo4j Connection
```bash
# In your backend directory
cd c:\Users\chuan\OneDrive\Documents\IsdaMarket
python -c "from app.database import init_database; init_database(); print('✅ Connected!')"
```

### 2. Start Backend Server
```bash
python run.py
```

### 3. Test Endpoints
Use the curl commands above or visit:
```
https://isdamarket-3.onrender.com/docs
```

### 4. Create Test Data
- Submit a review via the API
- Send a message via the API
- Place an order via the API

### 5. Check Neo4j Aura
- Open Neo4j Aura Browser
- Run the verification queries above
- Data should appear!
